## General info
We aim to provide the bank worker and manager, by using the technology of our time, a friendlier working environment. Through the use of smart AI, complex algorithms and embedded systems technologies, we aim to provide the manager the tools to monitor a messenger car and also the means to collect, analyze and display environmental data for example temperature and humidity. By using a smart AI we can assist our customers by automating life at work. For example lights will be automatic based on the daylight existence and a feature that automatically switches on and off the AC based on the temperature and humidity.
